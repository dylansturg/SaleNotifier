# SaleNotifier
An Android app to help people with finding great deals on products they want.

### Chart Support
The app regularly downloads pricing data for the items users track and maintains a record of each item's price over time.  This record is available through line charts

The data will be tracked for the interval specified in the item or app settings.

An example of a heavily populated chart:

![Heavily populated linechart of price data.](/screenshots/ScatteredChart.png?raw=true "Chart With Lots of Prices!")

The charts are touch enabled, allowing the user to select data points and zoom in/out horizontally and vertically.  The previous chart, zoomed in on the most recent data:

![Sparsely populated linechart of price data.](/screenshots/SparseChart.png?raw=true "Data zoomed in on the last 2 weeks")

The charts also include a legend which specifies all of the sellers listed on the chart.  Sellers are color coded.  The legend can be accessed from the overflow menu.
